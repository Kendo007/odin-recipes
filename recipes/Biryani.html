    <h2>Biryani perfect blend of spices and tender meats for a truly satisfying meal</h2>
    <p>
        Biryani is a popular dish in <strong>South Asian cuisine</strong>, particularly in India, Pakistan, and
        Bangladesh. It is a
        flavorful and aromatic rice dish that is typically made with meat (such as chicken, beef, or lamb), fish, or
        vegetables, along with a mix of spices and herbs. The ingredients are cooked together with basmati rice, and the
        dish is often garnished with fried onions, raisins, and cashews. Biryani is traditionally served as a main
        course and is often accompanied by a yogurt or raita, and a vegetable or meat based curry.

    <p>
        Biryani can vary in flavor and preparation depending on the region in which it is made. For example, in India,
        there are many different types of biryani, including Hyderabadi biryani, which is known for its use of saffron
        and meat (usually lamb or chicken), and Kolkata biryani, which is known for its use of potatoes and light
        spices. In Pakistan and Bangladesh, the most common type of biryani is made with meat (usually beef or chicken)
        and a mix of spices. Biryani is also a popular dish in other countries with a large South Asian population, such
        as the United Kingdom, United States, and Canada.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups basmati rice</li>
        <li>¼ cup cooking oil</li>
        <li>8 whole cloves</li>
        <li>4 black cardamom pods</li>
        <li>4 cinnamon sticks</li>
        <li>4 large onions, sliced thin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon garlic paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ginger paste</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        <li>1 pound lamb chops</li>
        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>3 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>4 green chile peppers, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons ground red pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons plain yogurt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>7 ½ cups water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, sliced</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon saffron</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons warm milk</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the basmati rice in a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 30
            minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 cup oil in a large skillet over medium heat; fry the cloves, cardamom pods, and cinnamon sticks in
            the hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions are lightly
            browned, about 5 minutes. Stir the garlic paste and ginger paste into the onion mixture; cook until the
            garlic and ginger is fragrant, about 1 minute more. Sprinkle the cilantro and mint over the mixture and cook
            1 minute more.</li>
        <li>Add the lamb chops to the skillet; season with salt. Cook and stir the lamb until the meat begins to brown,
            about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the tomatoes, green chile peppers, and ground red pepper into the mixture; continue cooking until the
            oil begins to separate from the gravy, about 10 minutes. Add the yogurt and lemon juice; cover and cook
            until the lamb is tender, about 15 minutes. Add water as needed to keep the mixture from getting too dry.
        </li>
        <li>Bring the rice, 7 1/2 cups water, and 1 teaspoon salt to a boil in a saucepan until the rice is nearly done
            yet a little chewy, 10 to 15 minutes; drain any excess water.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a small skillet; fry the sliced onion in the hot oil until lightly browned.</li>
        <li>Layer about half the rice in the bottom of a deep pot with a lid. Spoon the lamb masala over the rice.
            Spread the fried onion over the lamb masala. Top with the remaining rice. Stir the saffron and warm milk
            together in a small bowl; pour over the top layer of rice. Cover the pot with the lid and place the pot over
            low heat; cook until the rice is thoroughly cooked, about 15 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
