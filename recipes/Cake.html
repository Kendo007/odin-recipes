    <h2>Sponge cake is a light and airy baked sweet blast</h2>
    <p>
        Sponge cake is a classic and versatile baked good that is popular in many countries around the world. It is made
        by whipping eggs and sugar together until they are light and fluffy, and then gently folding in flour. This
        creates a batter that is delicate, airy, and has a spongy texture. The cake is then baked in an oven, resulting
        in a light and fluffy finished product. Sponge cake can be enjoyed on its own, or used as the base for various
        desserts such as trifles, jelly rolls, or Charlotte. It can also be flavored with various ingredients such as
        vanilla, lemon, or chocolate.
